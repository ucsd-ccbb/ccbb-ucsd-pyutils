Python utilities from CCBB at UCSD
==================================

This project contains a motley collection of utility methods
that have been developed over time to support the work of the
Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the
University of California at San Diego.  They are probably of
limited usefulness to users outside this coding ecosystem.
